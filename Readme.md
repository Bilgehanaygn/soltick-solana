Soltick aims to fully tokenize the ticketing process of organizations such as concerts, theatres, football matches etc.

Organizations can create tickets for an event issuing a certain amount, if the event is cancelled refunding is ensured by the solana program.

Users can sell their tickets online easily on the marketplace.

Tickets are burned by clicking the burn ticket button on the "gate", so organization can ensure a ticket is only used once.

Once a ticket is burnt, it can not be sold anymore, it cannot be sent to another wallet.
